/*
 * Card Styles
 * -----------
 * This file contains custom styles for card components, focusing on modern UI patterns
 * and smooth transitions. The styles here are designed to be used alongside the glass morphism
 * system for a cohesive look and feel.
 *
 * .card-modern
 *   - Applies a smooth transition and rounded corners to card elements.
 *   - On hover, cards are slightly elevated and a stronger shadow is applied for depth.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   Add the "card-modern" class to any container to give it a modern card appearance.
 *   Combine with "glass-card" for glassmorphic effects.
